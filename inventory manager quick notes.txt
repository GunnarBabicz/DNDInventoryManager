h2database is what was used with WGU
in memory


Tables:

Items
	ID(PK) int unsigned
	Quantity smallint unsigned (tiny int COULD be used here but smallint will allow more flexibility)
	Weight smallint unsigned
	Qualities varchar(255)
	Description varchar(255)
	isCurrency boolean (this will allow for currencies to use the same table but also be separate from other items)
	
	
	
Characters
	Name
	Class
	Stats
	Carry Weight (could be displayed as calculation)
	Currencies? May want to add a separate page for these or set it as a 
	
	
	IDEAS
	
	entityManager.find(example.class, 1) uses class, primary key. Otherwise returns null
	If using a player name for the primary key, could only allow the creation of a character if their name returns null in this (unique character name)
	
	Could also potentially use a variable with @GetMapping to allow procedural creation of links for the characters.
	Only potential issue with this would be how to keep DM's inventory "hidden". Honor code? Different class?
	Would be nice to have a GUI to allow players to check each other's inventory
